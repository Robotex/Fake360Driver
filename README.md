# Xbox Controller Driver for macOS

## Status
It's a work-in-progress, currently it produces a Fake360Test executable that enables the controller to report its input and displays it to console for debugging purposes.

## About
Fake360Driver is an another Xbox 360 controller driver which operates in userland similar to xboxdrv, allowing me to use it on OSX without the requirement to codesign it.
This project was started after my [issue](https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/issues/384) with the 360Controller driver was closed down without a fix and without finding any working alternative.

The Xbox360 Controller I own is a clone bought from Taobao labeled PC188 and is advertised as PC/XBOX360 compatible.
